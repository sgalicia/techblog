	<h2> Humans Need Not Apply</h2>

	<p> Humans Need Not Apply is an eye opening video on how technology has and will continue to take over. Mechanical muscles have replaced human muscles. In the past, most people would have had to contribute into the production of food but now that there are machines doing that work people are free to do anything else. Many have specialized in the programming of those machines that have taken over. So now there are much more people available to program mechanical minds. This has led to  mechanical minds replacing human mental labor just like mecahnical muscles replaced human muscles. This technological revolution is inevitable and through no fault of their own humans will cease to be employable since there will be a more efficient and cheaper Bot doing that work.

	This video was overwhelming but it didn't cause me to panic or anything of that nature. I have thought about technology and how it has taken over our lives so the video was no surprise. What this video did do is make me realize how smart technology has become. These machines or robots are literally being programmed to have a mind of their own. All of a sudden any theory of evil robots taking over the world became less of a far fetched	thought. I think it is important to remember that we have time until robots completly take over and there are also so many other factors that could ruin the future of the human race. Global warming is really kicking our ass right now and for all we know our dear leaders could start playing with their precious nuclear weapons.

	<h2>Blown To Bits</h2>
	<h3>Sheccid Galicia</h3>

	<p> FOOTPRINTS AND FINGERPRINTS talks about the digital prints that we leave behind everyday and everytime we use the internet. Because we leave these behind, it is easy to come up with evidence if needed. In addition to internet history, there are also cameras everywhere that can capture you in an encriminating position. Although digital fingerprints and footprints have helped a lot like for example solving legal cases, there are still negative aspects such as a lack of privacy. Because we are constanlty interacting with techno;ogy we are also constantly being monitored. </p>
	<p>TECHNOLOGY IS NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD explains how technology and the internet are only tools. Therefore they can be used for good and bad. Tech and the internet can facilitate both wholesome and maliciopus actions. This portion also says that "the key to managing the ethical and moral consequences of technology...is to regulate the use of technilogy without banning or restricting it's creation". The U.S does have laws in place regarding internet and technology.</p>
	<p>BLACK BOXES ARE NOT JUST FOR AIRPLANES ANYMORE talks about how black boxes or EDR's are now installed in most cars and collect all types of data. These help when trying to prove guilt or innocence in accidents. EDR's will provide information about how fast the vehicle was going and where it was.  It can even indicate whether the driver had on the sealtebelt or not. It also mentions that some people do not know that cars have these and police use this to their advantage during legal trials; questioning ethics.</p>
	<p>Much of what Blown To Bits talks about I had known or imagined was true. Though it did provide more details of what goes on behind the scenes of the internet and technology. It is overwhelming to know that privacy is basically not a thing anymore and how many people are okay with giving that up because they feel that having internet and tech is worth it. </p>
